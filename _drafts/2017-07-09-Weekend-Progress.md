title: Weekend Progress

Made some decent progress this weekend.

Saturday:
- Worked on this site and got the initial new layout finished.  This will change over time and I still need to make it more mobile responsive, but wanted something simple and fast.
- Finished up section 12 of the Web Developer's Bootcamp.  This puts me at 137/342 sections done.
