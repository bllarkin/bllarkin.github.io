title: Failure Already
---

You know what happens when you over-commit, then get overrun with day job stuff?  Hitting a wall.

In the last couple weeks, it has been startup for the school year for my day job.  With many changes we made over the summer (many of which took right to the last week), they have been very busy.  Even now things are hectic, though we have handled a few of the bigger issues and things are starting to settle down.

With all of that in mind, I realized how aggressive my original timeline was.  Basically, with everything else, I'm going to push everything back 2 months.

1. September 30 - Complete the [Web Developer Bootcamp from Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) (currently about 40% done)
2. November 30 - Complete the [freeCodeCamp Front End and Data Visualization Certificates](https://www.freecodecamp.com) (currently about 20% done)
3. February 28 - Complete the [freeCodeCamp Back End Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
4. June 30 - Complete the [freeCodeCamp Full Stack Development Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.com) by completing the Nonprofit Project work

I think the biggest thing to take away from any of this is just not quitting.  I'm going to keep moving this forward regardless of what is happening in my day-to-day and use the failure as fuel.
