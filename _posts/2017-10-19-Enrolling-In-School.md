title: Enrolling In School
---
So an interesting snap decision was made this week.  As I have been learning on my own, I'm learning I need a little bit more structure around my foundational learning.  I'm learning things as I explore, but I feel like I could be doing so much more efficiently and would be more effective with some deadlines and repercussions.

On top of all this, I feel like I don't have a great roadmap and I'm learning a lot of toolsets but there are some gaps.  Because of this, and since I have a job where I get a tuition break, I've applied for a software engineering program at Arizona State University.

Do I feel like this is going to slow me down a bit and push out my timeline?  Maybe, but only a little bit.  I'm still working with the resources I had before and will continue to work through those.  This is just supplemental for now.  I know where I want to be, and I'm hoping this will give some of the more formalized framework to accellerate a more in-depth learning for me.
